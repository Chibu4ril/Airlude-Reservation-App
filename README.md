# Flight Ticketing System

This is a simple flight ticket booking and management system built in Python. The system allows users to book, cancel, and edit their flight tickets, as well as view seating availability. It uses CSV files to store and manage ticket data, including cancelled tickets.

## Features
- **Book a Ticket**: Allows users to book a flight by entering their personal details and assigning a seat.
- **Cancel a Ticket**: Users can cancel their booking, which moves the ticket to the "cancelled" list.
- **Edit a Ticket**: Allows users to update their booking information (e.g., name).
- **View Tickets**: Users can view their current reservations.
- **View Seating Availability**: Displays the current seating arrangement in the aircraft and shows booked/available seats.
- **CSV Storage**: All data is saved to CSV files for persistence and can be modified via the system.

## Installation

To use the Flight Ticketing System, you need to have Python and a text editor e.g Pycharm(Community Edition was used) installed. Follow these steps to set up the application:

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/flight-ticketing-system.git
   cd flight-ticketing-system
   ```

2. **Install the necessary dependencies**:
   The app uses Python's built-in libraries, so there are no external dependencies to install.

3. **Run the Application**:
   To start using the system, run the following command:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

   Follow the interactive prompts to book, cancel, or modify flight tickets.

## Usage

Once the system is running, you'll be prompted with the following menu options:

1. **Book a seat**: To book a new ticket.
2. **Read existing ticket**: View the details of an existing booking by entering your ticket number.
3. **Cancel a ticket**: Cancel an existing ticket by entering the ticket number.
4. **Edit ticket**: Modify the details of an existing reservation.
5. **View seating**: Display a seating chart of the aircraft showing available and booked seats.
6. **Exit**: To exit the application.

### Example Workflow
1. Select "Book a seat" to enter your personal details and book a flight.
2. After booking, select "View seating" to check availability.
3. If needed, you can cancel or edit your booking by selecting the respective option and providing the ticket number.

## Technical Overview

The system is built using Python and implements basic object-oriented programming (OOP) principles. Here's a brief breakdown of its components:

### File Structure

```
/flight-ticketing-system
    /ticketconfig.py        # Contains classes for managing active and cancelled tickets
    /api.py                 # Contains CSVQuery class to handle CSV file operations
    /main.py                # Main application logic that interacts with users
    /flight_db.csv          # CSV file for storing active flight tickets
    /cancelled_tickets.csv  # CSV file for storing cancelled flight tickets
```

### Classes Overview

#### TicketConfig
The `TicketConfig` class defines the structure of a flight ticket. It contains:
- `__init__`: Initializes the ticket attributes like `customer_id`, `fullname`, `ticket_number`, etc.
- `prep_payload`: Prepares the ticket's attributes into a dictionary for storage.
- `payload_unwrapper`: Converts a dictionary back into a `TicketConfig` object.

#### CancelledTicketConfig
This class is similar to `TicketConfig` but includes an additional attribute: `cancelled_date`. This is used for tickets that have been cancelled.
- `cancelled_ticket_payload`: Converts the cancelled ticket into a dictionary format for CSV storage.
- `payload_unwrapper_2`: Converts a dictionary back into a `CancelledTicketConfig` object.

#### CSVQuery
The `CSVQuery` class is responsible for interacting with the CSV files. It handles:
- Reading the ticket data from `flight_db.csv` and `cancelled_tickets.csv`.
- Writing updated ticket data back to the respective CSV files.

#### Ticketing
The `Ticketing` class provides the main functionality of the app:
- **Book Seat**: Allows users to book a flight by providing their personal information and seat preferences.
- **Cancel Ticket**: Cancels a ticket and moves it to the cancelled tickets list.
- **Edit Ticket**: Allows users to modify their booking information.
- **Display Seating**: Displays the current seating chart of the aircraft with booked and available seats.
